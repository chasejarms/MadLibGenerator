  <h1>Mad Lib Generator</h1>
  <p>Ever heard of MadLibs? Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story, before reading the - often comical or nonsensical - story aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime. The game was invented in the United States, and more than 110 million copies of Mad Libs books have been sold since the series was first published in 1958.
